# Computer Vision
My experimentations with computer vision mainly using OpenCV. There are still some spin off projects that I have not put here. There is one where the robot moves depending on the webcam average color (terrible idea).

The source for the demonstration below can be found in WebcamTriangleFinder. I used the orientation of a triangle to control the robot. (see my nxt project for the protocol I came up with)
